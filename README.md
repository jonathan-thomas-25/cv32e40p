# OpenHW Group CORE-V CV32E40P RISC-V IP

CV32E40P is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 4-stage pipeline that implements
the RV32IM\[F|Zfinx\]C instruction set architecture, and the PULP custom extensions for achieving
higher code density, performance, and energy efficiency \[[1](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2654506)\], \[[2](https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2017.8106976)\].
It started its life as a fork of the OR10N CPU core that is based on the OpenRISC ISA.
Then, under the name of RI5CY, it became a RISC-V core (2016), and it has been maintained
by the [PULP platform](https://www.pulp-platform.org/) team until February 2020,
when it has been contributed to [OpenHW Group](https://www.openhwgroup.org/).

## Verification

In this forked repository. I created a very straightforward UVM testbench with testcases targeting the alu.
The UVM components include
1.driver
2.sequencer
3.monitor
4.agent
5.environment
6.tests

Seperate sequences are written for each individual instructions and also for each type of instructions(eg comparison, arithmetic etc).
